<p align="CENTER" style="line-height: 150%"><span style="text-transform: uppercase"><font face="Tahoma" size="3" color="#0000FF">All seeking to evolve into their fullest potential come face to face with the concept of "enlightenment". Yet, for most this mystical state of fully awakened consciousness remains an intellectual concept; a state of being as unattainable as winning a national
lottery. Is it possible that our concept of enlightenment is misguided? Because if this is so, we may be striving to accomplish a state of being that may not even exist.</font></span></p>
<p align="CENTER" style="line-height: 150%">&nbsp;</p>
<font face="Tahoma" size="2"><p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
</font>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Tahoma">I used to think enlightenment was a singular&nbsp;experience in which there would be an internal cosmic firework&nbsp;display, followed by astounding revelations of biblical proportions,&nbsp;ending in the complete adjustment of my perceptual relationship with&nbsp;everything in this world. I approached and eagerly searched for this&nbsp;experience as a definite point of arrival in which I would&nbsp;finally understand everything, and simultaneously feel deliriously&nbsp;wonderful forever and ever, Amen! Was I so wrong! I am still&nbsp;open to such an inner experience, but as I continue my journey along&nbsp;the corridors of this life I am discovering&nbsp;that "enlightenment is definitely not what I thought it was". Thank God for that!</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Tahoma">First of all, just being aware there is a&nbsp;state of being called "enlightenment" is in itself an experience&nbsp;of enlightenment. Many humans are so bound by their past, by&nbsp;the consequences of their thoughts, words, and deeds, that all their&nbsp;energy is invested into survival. They do not even look up and&nbsp;ask, "Why is the sky blue?" They are just grateful that it is&nbsp;not raining on them that particular day. For such an individual to awaken&nbsp;to the idea that there is more to a life experience than endless&nbsp;sorrow, toil, and hardship, is enlightenment.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Tahoma">Once I was able to let go of the misconception that enlightenment&nbsp;was a singular, explosive experience, and that it was actually&nbsp;something more realistic than an internal fireworks display&nbsp;followed by delirious grinning 24 hours a day, I became&nbsp;vulnerable to a completely different perspective; that enlightenment&nbsp;is ongoing, and will hopefully continue to be so eternally.</font> </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Tahoma">Funnily&nbsp;enough, the experience that shook me out of my illusions about&nbsp;enlightenment occurred through an intimate relationship. When I was about 38 I&nbsp;was attracted to, and became intimately involved with a wonderful&nbsp;woman who was much younger than I. My mind told me this was not&nbsp;beneficial. Fortunately, my heart overrode my conservatism. It&nbsp;was during this relationship that I discovered the meaning of&nbsp;intimacy. I now love the word "intimacy"; for me its authentic&nbsp;meaning is revealed within the phonetics of the word: into-me-and-see.&nbsp;During that intimate encounter I realized that it was not&nbsp;enlightenment I was looking for at all; it was intimacy.</font> </p>
<font face="Tahoma" size="2">
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"></p>
</font>
<p align="CENTER" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Tahoma">I was&nbsp;desperately seeking intimacy with myself, with God, with nature,&nbsp;with my family, with all humans I encountered, with my cats, with my&nbsp;writing, with plants, with the falling rain, with my pain, with my&nbsp;dreams and visions, and with all the minute aspects of this&nbsp;experience we call "living our life", like washing dishes and doing&nbsp;laundry.</font></p>
<font face="Tahoma" size="2">
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"></p>
</font>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Tahoma">Of course, intimacy, to be authentic, demands we consciously show up and&nbsp;be "present" with all our experiences. Realizing this, to me, was an&nbsp;enlightening moment. And, I only came to this realization by&nbsp;entering an experience my mind totally resisted. I then also&nbsp;realized that up until that moment I had been using my mind as the&nbsp;primary tool with which to seek enlightenment; I thought I could&nbsp;achieve it through thinking, understanding, and analysis. Again, I was mistaken.</font> </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Tahoma">Today I am glad&nbsp;I am not enlightened, as in having arrived at a cosmic destination&nbsp;and receiving a "Degree in Enlightenment" from the multiverse&nbsp;establishing me as having accomplished "the ultimate spiritual&nbsp;task". Today I perceive enlightenment on many levels, and one of&nbsp;these is the acceptance that everyday is saturated with enlightening&nbsp;experiences, if I just let them in. Now my life is littered with&nbsp;ongoing potential points for enlightenment:</font></p>

<p align="CENTER" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Tahoma">When we discover that enlightenment is not what we <i>thought</i> it&nbsp;was, then we enter a point of authentic enlightenment that&nbsp;opens a doorway to endless points of enlightenment.

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Tahoma">Discovering&nbsp;that enlightenment is "not what we thought it was" is cause for&nbsp;celebration!

</font> </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Tahoma">To remain in this state of wonder requires keeping an open mind.&nbsp;Whenever we make our mind up about something, we simultaneously&nbsp;close a door to continued growth. Knowing that we make such errors&nbsp;along the way is enlightening. Knowing that there is always more to&nbsp;discover is enlightening. By&nbsp;approaching enlightenment in this way, as an endless journey of&nbsp;ongoing "Aha's!" we allow our life experiences to be an endless story that God is&nbsp;telling us so that we may discover and rediscover our unlimited,&nbsp;endless, eternal, and mysterious self.
</font> </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Tahoma">I am also open to being&nbsp;totally wrong about all of this. If I discover I am, this&nbsp;too will be enlightening.
