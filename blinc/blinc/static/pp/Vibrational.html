<p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Tahoma" size="3">It is recommended we commence
and complete each day with this practice – wielding it as a practical means for aligning ourselves consciously with the causal point of life: The vibrational current flowing through ourselves and all manifestations we call "creation".</font></p><font face="Tahoma" size="3">
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%">The vibrational technology offered here is not religious or spiritual – it is simply a perceptual mechanism honoring the manner in which human experience flows outwardly from its unified source. Through its application, we train our capacities to consciously
work with the natural flow of our awareness as it moves outward into the world
and also back into our ultimate causal point. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%">Applying this practice daily is a
simple, effortless and efficient means to remain causal within all our inner and outer activities. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%">When consistently applied, the consequences of wielding this perceptual technology
is self-evident as noticeable perceptual shifts within our daily experience and
the effortlessness in which we receive what we require for our evolution. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%">Even though this technology is vulnerable to triggering inner experiences
– the emphasis in applying it daily is not on "having an inner experience". Rather, the intent is to enhance our level of causal
awareness within all our encounters, inner and outer.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%">Sit comfortably, cross-legged or on a chair, with your back straight but relaxed. Make sure you are not cold. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%">Keep eyes closed for the entire practice.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%">Connect your breathing for 15 minutes. [As per The Presence Process, this means breathing in and out without any long gaps/pauses between
breaths. An <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111019085433/http://thepresenceportal.com/how_we_breathe.htm" target="_blank">audio demonstration</a>
of this breathing practice is available on the AUDIO page of this website.] </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%">Breathe intensely enough so as you are able to clearly hear your own breathing. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%">Preferably breathe in and out through the nose only, but if the nose is blocked, breathe in and out only through the mouth.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%">In synch with your breathing, mentally repeat the expression: <b>"I AM HERE NOW
IN THIS"</b>. I [during the in-breath] AM [during the out-breath] HERE [during
the in-breath] NOW [during the out-breath] IN [during the in-breath], THIS
[during the out-breath].</p>

<blockquote>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%">Now take you attention off your breathing and allow it to instead rest at the point your awareness resides when you are "present with your eyes closed". This inner point, slightly above and between your physical eyes, is your eye-center.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%">While at rest within your eye center, mentally repeat <b>"I AM HERE NOW
IN THIS"</b> for about 10 minutes.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%">Each time you become aware your attention has wandered away from this deliberate repetition into other unconsciously-generated thought packages, gently bring it back and continue deliberate repetition. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%">Become aware of the two distinct places your awareness is able to reside during this practice: Present in deliberate
mental repetition at your eye center – and, wandering unconsciously away from your eye-center into the dream state we call "thinking" [about past and future].</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%">Do not be concerned about this unconscious wandering, simply observe it. Be with it without condition.</p>

<blockquote>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%">Cease all mental repetition and the
feeling of your overall vibrational field and focus only on <b>listening.</b> </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%">First listen for a few moments to whatever sounds you hear in the world around you. Listen to them without condition. Listen to them as if audibly "receiving them" – as if now being "a receiver" of these audio vibrations.
Allow yourself to perceive all these outer sounds, no matter what they are, as
being emitted by the one unified causal point of all that is. As if all these
accumulated outer sounds make up "God talking".&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%">Now, gently withdraw your awareness from these outer sounds and allow yourself to once again rest within your point of inner presence - at the eye center. This time, listen
only for sounds coming from <i>within you.</i> Whatever you hear is valid. If you hear nothing, listen to this nothingness.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%">As you listen to these inner sounds – or the nothingness
within - ensure your attention remains anchored at the eye center.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%">Each time you become aware your attention has wandered away from deliberately listening at the eye center into following unconsciously-generated thought packages or outer sounds, gently bring it back and continue deliberate listening. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%">Become aware of the two distinct places you are able to reside during this
part of the practice: Present in deliberate listening at your eye center – and, wandering unconsciously away from your eye-center in the dream state called "thinking" [about past and future].</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%">Do not be concerned about this unconscious wandering, simply observe it. Be with it without condition.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%">Listen inwardly for about 5 minutes – and longer than this as you wish. </p>
<b></b><p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"><b>This state of "listening", of "being a receiver", is vibrational contemplation.</b> <i>Listening</i> is how the heart initially feels the vibrational.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%">&nbsp;</p></blockquote>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%">Once listening to any inner sound - or the nothingness
within - we are now at <i>the doorway of our inner portal into vibrational awareness.</i> Whatever occurs beyond this point is ours to keep as a treasure for our inner wealth and outer well-being.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%">The efficiency of this practice is not in <i>what we hear</i> <i>inwardly</i>, but in our capacity to remain "in a state of listening". This "state of listening" – of consciously "being a receiver" - empowers our becoming vulnerable to "consciously receiving all we require for our daily encounters directly from our unified source". As our capacity to listen evolves, so too does our capacity to receive.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 150%">This vibrational practice is not about perfection – it is about full-participation in our human experience from "a causal point of you". Don’t <i>try</i>. Relax into it and enjoy the inevitable consequence. Effortlessness comes from effortlessness.</p>
